# NHCarrigan Mentorship Archive

This organisation holds the flagship project repositories for folks who have either resigned from our programme or been removed for inactivity.

We preserve this code so that our students may revisit it at any time, and so we may restore it if they choose to re-enrol.

[You probably want our main organisation, to be honest.](https://github.com/nhcarrigan-mentorship)
